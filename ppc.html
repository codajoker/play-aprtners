                  We won’t be telling you anything groundbreaking when we say
                  that PPC traffic is one of the hottest commodities in the
                  iGaming scene. But what’s truly phenomenal about it is that
                  it’s not just popular, it’s gaining momentum year after year,
                  with no plans of slowing down. <br /><br />
                  PPC is one of the most valuable types of traffic in affiliate
                  marketing. Affiliate networks and advertisers are all chasing
                  after it. And webmasters who bring in quality PPC traffic get
                  some hefty rewards. <br /><br />
                  So, what exactly is this beast? And how do you work with it?
                  Let’s dive deeper.

              We are a team of professionals who spent years in the affiliate
              marketing and gambling field, so we have a deep understanding of
              the product and methods that really work.
              <br />
              All articles for each section will be on one page, arranged one
              after another in a horizontal row. This will be similar to the way
              Instagram stories work. Most of the picture space is taken up by
              the article that comes first, followed by the next article on the
              side, then the next, and so on. A person scrolls the arrow to the
              side and can select the article they like.
              <br />
              <br />
              This principle of article placement applies to all sections of the
              blog.
              <br />
              <br />
              The design of the sections themselves repeats the above example.
              That is, in the center there is a large picture with the banner of
              the first article, and on the sides or slightly behind (as on the
              references) - text with the name of each section.
            </p> -->
            <p><strong>Nice to meet you, I’m PPC!</strong></p>
            <p>
              PPC, or Pay-Per-Click, is a traffic model where webmasters pay for
              advertising based on user actions, specifically clicks. This comes
              with its first advantage: you’re not wasting your budget on
              irrelevant impressions, but rather investing in a relevant
              audience that’s interested in your ad.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em
                >* It’s a great way not only to attract leads that could
                potentially become active players but also to optimize
                expenses.</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              With this model, how much you’ll spend on advertising and how many
              people will see it depends on the platform’s algorithm where
              you’re running your ads. It’ll conduct an auction and analyze the
              following factors:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your bid per click</li>
              <li>Ad completeness</li>
              <li>The audience you’re targeting</li>
              <li>Competition based on the geographical location</li>
              <li>Their forecast of effectiveness</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong> Where to get PPC traffic? </strong></p>
            <p>
              The second advantage of PPC traffic is its flexibility, making it
              available on practically all platforms. The most popular ones
              include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Search engines (Google Ads, Bing Ads, and others)</li>
              <li>Social networks (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram)</li>
              <li>Native Advertising</li>
              <li>DSP (Demand-Side Platform)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can find PPC traffic using any of these sources, BUT!</p>
            <p>
              <em
                >* The most valuable, relevant, and high-quality traffic is
                often considered to come from major platforms. That’s why in
                affiliate marketing, PPC traffic from Google Ads tends to rake
                in particularly good profits.</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>To launch or not to launch, that is the question!</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Working with PPC traffic is appealing and comes with an impressive
              list of advantages. But to say that you won’t encounter any
              drawbacks when facing this model head-on would be a lie.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the pros of PPC that we’ve already covered, it’s
              also essential to mention:

                Working with warm audiences who come to you with the right

                High demand in the market. If you know how to bring in cool PPC
                traffic in good volume and on a regular basis, you stand a
                chance of getting more favorable terms from both affiliate
                networks and advertisers
              </li>
              <li>
                The ability to work with practically most existing verticals
              </li>
              <li>
                SEO optimization of landing pages based on keyword analysis,
                thereby increasing the effectiveness of ad campaigns
              </li>
              <li>
                Precise statistics needed for optimization and increasing ROI
              </li>
              <li>Predictability, which simplifies budget calculations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              However, here are some not-so-pleasant aspects you might face:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                High competition, leading to potential advertising costs.
                Besides advertising budgets, you’ll also need to spend on
                essentials like accounts, proxies, cards, and so on
              </li>
              <li>
                It’s only suitable for one goal – lead generation. If your goal
                is, for instance, to increase brand awareness or the number of
                visits, it’s better to choose another format
              </li>
              <li>
                It’s a rough ride for newcomers. PPC advertising has its own
                specifics that require time and tests to learn, and only then
                can you come out on top
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong
                >When choosing to “launch”, consider some key points that will
                help your advertising more effective</strong
              >
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Create highly informative creatives and ads that immediately
                convey to the audience that you’re exactly what they’ve been
                looking for. If you want to pay for irrelevant clicks, skip this
                step
              </li>
              <li>
                Try to minimize “branded” keywords (usually they’re paid at a
                lower rate or not paid at all) and build your campaign around
                “general” ones: there’s higher competition, bids, and a better
                chance to bring in a fresh audience
              </li>
              <li>
                Stay trendy – add colloquial keywords. More and more users are
                forming queries using voice input, so conversational keywords
                are becoming increasingly popular
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure you’re protected from click fraud: set up traffic
                distribution and regularly monitor statistics in your tracker to
                immediately disable the campaign in case of unusual bot or
                competitor activity
              </li>
              <li>
                Negative keywords are your best friends. They help improve
                traffic quality and reduce promotion costs
              </li>
              <li>
                Keywords require ongoing work. Just adding them won’t be enough.
                You need to analyze, expand, change, and, importantly,
                prioritize them
              </li>
              <li>
                Remember, on the road to profit, it’s not just about the
                campaign, but also the landing page. It should be informative,
                optimized for keywords, and encourage action
              </li>
              <li>Don’t forget about retargeting 😉</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong
                >Next step – just tests… and knowing common mistakes to
                avoid.</strong
              >
            </p>
            <p>For example,</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Not deleting ineffective keywords, thus giving away more and
                getting less
              </li>
              <li>Not using daily budget spending strategies</li>
              <li>Not pausing the campaign while it’s under moderation</li>
              <li>Not using UTM tags</li>
              <li>
                Not working with automation services: bid management, keyword
                gathering, ad management
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              And for those who still choose to “launch”, we’ll help choose
              profitable offers with good terms. And here, there’s no need for
              lengthy analysis or philosophical pondering, just message our
