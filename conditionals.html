                <br />

                To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event

                Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or

                which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In
                these states, each party's liability will be limited to the
                greatest extent permitted by law.

                course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade
                practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company
                provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation
                of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements,
                achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any

                <br />
                Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of
                the company's provider makes any representation or warranty of
                any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or
                availability of the Service, or the information, content, and
                materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service
                will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy,
                reliability, or currency of any information or content provided
                through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the
                content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are
                free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware,

                Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types
                of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
                consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations
                may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and
                limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the
                greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.
